## Assignment

Given a React app that uses the `useRef` hook, your task is to modify the code such that the app functions as it did before and the test cases pass again.

### Steps

1.  Clone the `repository` to your local machine.
2.  Open the `src/App.js` file and modify the code as stated.
3.  Run the test cases to ensure that everything works as expected.

### Notes

-   The test cases are written in Cypress and can be run using the `npx cypress run` command.
-   The React app was created using Create React App (CRA) and uses functional components and the `useRef` hook.
